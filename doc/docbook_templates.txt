*docbook_templates.txt* Plugin that inclides snippets of DocBook structures to make editing faster.

                                                           *docbook_templates-installation*
I recommend using a plugin manager such as vim-plug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
to install and update vim-daps.
If you do not want to use a plugin manager, download and uncompress the tarball into
your ~/.vim/plugin directory.

                                                           *docbook_templates-requirements*
You need to have 'vim-xml' (https://vimawesome.com/plugin/xml-vim) installed to use vim-docbook_templates
commands in your Vim editor.

Commands:
:DocbkSurroundListitems <il> <trim>
  Creates <listitem><para>'s from selected lines of plain text.
  'il' argument adds <itemizedlist> around the lines, and adding 'trim'
  first removes blank spaces at the beginning of text lines.

  Example: :DocbkSurroundListitems 0 trim

:DocbkIlist2Proc
  Converts <itemizedlist> to <procedure>.

:DocbkProc2Ilist
  Converts <procedure> to <itemizedlist>.
